# Snippets in VSCode

##### (feature for quickly adding code for functions, if-else statements and much more)

1. In settings search for Snippet Suggestions and switch "inline" to "top"
2. In a .js file write for example fun and intellisense should show function, press enter and code for creating a function will be inserted
3. Like this:
```js
function name(params) {
  
}
```
4. The function name is selected and you can type to replace the text with your desired function name
5. If you press tab the cursor jumps to params where you can write parameter names
6. If you press tab again the cursor jumps to the next row where you can write the code itself
7. You can also use shift tab to jump backwards
8. Success!
