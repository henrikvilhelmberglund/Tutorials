# Command Center in VSCode

Command Center is a feature in VSCode that turns the top text bar into a **clickable bar** with some cool features.

To enable it go to **Settings** - search for **Command Center** and tick the checkbox. After that you get a bar at the top with the name of your project that you can click to use the features.

My recommendation is to also add a shortcut key for **Launch Command Center**

## Search

**Type something in the field** and you'll get files from your workspace as search results. I use this a lot when using SvelteKit, just search for + and you'll get **all the +page.svelte routes** (after excluding .js and so on in settings). Very handy when you have lots of files!

## Go to symbol in editor

By typing **@** you can get a list of all of the symbols (**functions, variables, properties** and so on) in your file. Very useful if you want to find a **certain CSS class** for example. 

...actually, if it's a CSS class just get the [CSS Navigation extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pucelle.vscode-css-navigation) instead and peek the definition. (protip)

If you want to **sort the symbols by type** just type **@:**

## Tasks
> ...what's a task? 

Tasks are... tasks. For example the scripts in your package.json. If you don't use something like **npm** tasks are probably not that useful.

By typing **task (task name here)** you can run these from the Command Center. Here's a spicy example of a custom (overwritten) task:

```json
  //tasks.json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "npm",
      "script": "dev",
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "label": "dev",
      "detail": "vite dev",
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "never"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This is the "dev" task I made to find out what tasks actually do. I got the base config file tasks.json by executing the command **Configure Task and choosing npm:dev**. I renamed it to just **dev** because that way I know it's my custom task. I also added 
```json
"presentation": {
        "reveal": "never"
      }
```

to make it **launch silently**. So instead of
- Open the terminal
- run `npm run dev`
- close the terminal

I can do this:

- Click the Command Center at the top of the screen
- Click tasks
- Click dev

Easy peasy! Or, the keyboard version:

- Press your shortcut for Launch Command Center (you need to add this in keyboard shortcuts)
- Type `task dev` and press enter
😁

## Other stuff

There are a few other things you can do:

- : to go to a certain line
- `>` to open the command palette
- ?debug to start debugging
- ?edt to view a list of all open files

And probably more. But honestly the top 2 alone make it good enough.

Don't forget to **set a shortcut key** (or just click the top) and **enjoy the Command Center**!
