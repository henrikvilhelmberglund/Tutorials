# Code Runner in VSCode

##### (for running JavaScript code only projects in the VSCode console)

1. Download NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
2. In VSCode, find Extensions in the left side panel and search for Code Runner
3. Click Code Runner and Install
4. Create a new .js file and copy paste `console.log("Success!");`
5. Press Ctrl+Alt+n to run the code and show the output in the bottom panel Output tab
6. **Success!** (hopefully)

Tip 1: You can change the shortcut key in Ctrl+k Ctrl+s (search for Run Code)

Tip 2: In case you have a web project using document and so on but still would like to run the code using Node you can wrap the code in an if statement:

```js
//from https://flaviocopes.com/error-document-not-defined/
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  //here `window` is available, so `window.document` (or simply `document`) is available too

  function editParagraphs() {
    let paragraph = document.querySelector("p");
    paragraph.innerText = "Ã¤ndrad paragraphtext";
  }
  editParagraphs();
}
```
