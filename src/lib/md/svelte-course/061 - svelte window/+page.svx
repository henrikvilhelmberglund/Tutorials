<script>
  import ShowMany from "$lib/ShowMany.svelte";
  import App from "./App.svelte";
  import AppRaw from "./App.svelte?raw";
  import App2 from "./App2.svelte";
  import App2Raw from "./App2.svelte?raw";
</script>

Another Svelte special element is {"<"}svelte:window>.

Here we want to see the width and have it change whenever we resize the window. We also want to focus the search bar whenever we press ctrl+f.

<ShowMany name={[
{name: "App", comp:App, raw:AppRaw, text: "Here it is normally without using svelte:window. Let's try to rewrite it using svelte:window>."},
{name: "App2", comp:App2, raw:App2Raw, text: "By using svelte:window we can bind to the innerWidth variable and remove that function. We can also remove the onMount lifecycle functions and instead put the event handlers on the svelte:window element itself."},
]}/>

Svelte bindings (bind:) are usually two way bindings but here everything except scrollX and scrollY are readonly so effectively they are one way bindings.

Here is a list of the properties we can bind to:

- innerWidth
- innerHeight
- outerWidth
- outerHeight
- scrollX (not readonly)
- scrollY (not readonly)
- online â€” an alias for window.navigator.onLine
