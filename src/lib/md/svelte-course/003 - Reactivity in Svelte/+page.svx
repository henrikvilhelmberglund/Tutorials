<script>
  import Count from "./Count.svx";
  import CountObject from "./CountObject.svx";
  import CountObjectWrong from "./CountObjectWrong.svx";
  import CountArray from "./CountArray.svx";
  import CountArrayFixed from "./CountArrayFixed.svx";
  import CountArrayFixed2 from "./CountArrayFixed2.svx";
</script>

In Svelte we can have something called **Reactivity**, basically meaning: *When we update variables, update the DOM as well.*

One way of achieving this is to simply **assign a variable in the top level**

<Count/>

The variable **type** doesn't really matter, but we **do** need to change the value using one of three methods.

1. Assignment. `count = 10;`
2. Update statements. `count++;`
3. Updating/assigning a property. `obj.count++;`

<CountObject/>

Here are some of the things that will **not** trigger reactivity.

### Don't do this

1. Indirect object references

<CountObjectWrong/>

2. Array methods

<CountArray/>

### Instead: spread syntax

Instead of using array methods we can use **spread syntax**.

<CountArrayFixed/>

Or, we can just do **array = array;**. It is a bit ugly but it works!

<CountArrayFixed2/>
