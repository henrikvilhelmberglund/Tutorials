<script>
  import ShowMany from "$lib/ShowMany.svelte";
  import App from "./App.svelte";
  import AppRaw from "./App.svelte?raw"; 
  import useViewportActionRaw from "./useViewportAction?raw";

</script>

This is an example of **use:viewport** which will tell us when an element **enters** the viewport or **leaves** the viewport.

<ShowMany name={[
{name: "App", comp:App, raw:AppRaw, text: ""},
{name: "useViewportAction.js", comp:App, raw:useViewportActionRaw, text: ""},
]}/>

An important thing here is the **lazy initialization** of the action. The IntersectionObserver is only created when it is **needed**. We also reuse the observer if we already have one. Without this this whole page broke. ðŸ¤¯
